The Makefile in this directory has all you need to upload a new package
to binstar.

Here is a checklist

- update the version number in setup.py
- upload the new version to pypi
    python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi
- run conda skeleton in a temp directory somewhere to make pandashells yaml
    conda skeleton pypi pandashells
- run vimdiff with yaml in this directory and do appropriate updates to yaml in this directory (should only need to change version and hash info)
- run the following
    conda create -n builder python=2.7
    . activate builder
    make clean
    make upload
